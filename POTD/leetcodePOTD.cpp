/* ===================================================================
 * PROBLEM 3330: FIND THE ORIGINAL TYPED STRING I (LeetCode)
 * =================================================================== */

/**
 * @brief Return the total number of possible original strings
 *
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Alice typed a string `word` on her keyboard. She may have pressed at most
 * one key for **too long**, causing a character to repeat one or more times.
 *
 * You are given the final string `word`. Determine how many **possible original
 * strings** Alice could have intended to type.
 *
 * A character group of repeated characters could be reduced to just one character
 * (only one group can be reduced in total).
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input:  word = "aaab"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Alice may have intended to type "aab", "ab", or "aaab".
 *
 * APPROACH:
 * - Traverse the string and identify groups of consecutive identical characters.
 * - Each such group (of length > 1) is a candidate for being the *long press* group.
 * - Only one group can be reduced — total possible original strings = number of such groups + 1
 *   (1 for the case where Alice didn't long press at all).
 *
 * STRATEGY:
 * - Initialize `possible = 1` for the no-long-press case.
 * - For each index `i`, if word[i] == word[i-1], it is part of a long-press group.
 *   Increment `possible` for each group (counted only once per group).
 *
 * @param word The final typed string shown on screen
 * @return int Total number of possible original strings
 *
 * @complexity
 * Time: O(N) — single traversal of the string
 * Space: O(1) — constant extra space

 class Solution {
    public:
        int numberOfPossibleOriginalStrings(string word) {
            int possible = 1;  // No long-press case is always valid

            for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); i++) {
                // If a new long-press group starts
                if (word[i] == word[i - 1]) {
                    possible++;
                }
            }

            return possible;
        }
    };
